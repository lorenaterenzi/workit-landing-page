# Frontend Mentor - Workit landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Workit landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/workit-landing-page-2fYnyle5lu). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

I've had a hard time doing the rounded borders required and placing the different images at their respective places, it brought me a lot of knowledge about positioning with CSS and how to use "divs" to build shapes. The project is not perfect and it needs a lot of work still, but since I haven't used any other technologies I think I did pretty well. After I've studied some other ways of building pages, I'll remake this challenge.

## Built with

- VSCode
- HTML
- CSS

### The challenge

The challenge consists in building a responsive page with the designed layout.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
